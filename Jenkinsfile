Sure, here is the formatted Jenkins pipeline script:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Acquiring source code from the specified directory path in the environment variable."
                echo "Building the project and creating necessary artifacts."
            }
        }
        stage('Testing') {
            steps {
                echo "Executing unit tests."
                echo "Executing integration tests."
                echo "Execution done."
            }
        }
        stage('Static Code Analysis') {
            steps {
                echo "Analyzing code quality using a static analysis tool."
                echo "Done"
            }
        }
        stage('Security Analysis') {
            steps {
                echo "Performing security scans to detect vulnerabilities."
            }
        }
        stage('Staging Environment Testing') {
            steps {
                echo "Conducting integration tests on the staging setup."
            }
        }
        stage('Production Deployment') {
            steps {
                echo "Releasing the application to the production environment."
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        success {
            emailext attachLog: true,
            compressLog: true,
            to: 'meetgadhiya8888@gmail.com',
            body: 'Log is available at $JENKINS_HOME/jobs/$JOB_NAME/builds/lastSuccessfulBuild/log',
            subject: 'Production Deployment is Successful - Jenkins'
        }
        failure {  
            emailext attachLog: true,
            compressLog: true,
            to: 'meetgadhiya8888@gmail.com',
            body: 'Log is available at $JENKINS_HOME/jobs/$JOB_NAME/builds/lastSuccessfulBuild/log',
            subject: "Production Deployment has Failed - Jenkins"
        }
    }
}
```
